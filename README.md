# Problem Set 6
Due the night of April 15th at midnight

## Instructions
The homework PDF has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob1.py` to practice creating simple classes with common methods.
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to practice working dictionaries and reading in content from files.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - Autotests for Prob 1 are in place. I'm still working on autotests for Prob 2.
