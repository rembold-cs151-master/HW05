Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of February 28 at midnight!


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] No need for any pdf on this assignment, as there is no handwritten work
 - [ ] Add docstrings to `Prob1.py` for each of the 3 provided functions.
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` for recursive functions and population modeling.
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob3.py` to practice file input and output as well as string manipulations.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - Prob 1
 	- Automated tests will just check for the presence of docstrings.
 - Prob 2
 	- Automated tests will check all template functions
 - Prob 3
 	- Automated tests will check all template functions
	- Automated tests will also check for the presence of `flushes.txt` and roughly check its content
