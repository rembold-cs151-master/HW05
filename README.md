# Problem Set 6
Due the night of November the 12st at midnight!

## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob1.py` to practice creating simple classes with common methods.
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to practice working with inheritance for graphical classes.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - I'll get autotests for these written and posted soon!
