_Please insert an x in the square brackets above to mark the assignment as submitted!_

Due the night of November the 1st at midnight!

## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob1.py` to practice file input and output as well as string manipulations.
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to practice dealing with multidimensional arrays.
 - [ ] `Prob3.py` is optional but you can do it for extra credit if you want!

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - Prob 1
 	- Automated tests will check all template functions
	- Automated tests will also check for the presence of `hands_flushes.txt` and roughly check its content
 - Prob 2
 	- Automated tests will check all template functions
 - Prob 3
 	- Automated tests will check all template functions
	- You need to opt into these by changing the `autochecking` variable at the top to `True`, as I didn't want people who didn't attempt the extra credit to have it messing with their autochecker results on the first two problems.
